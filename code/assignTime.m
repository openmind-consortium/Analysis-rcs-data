function outputDataTable = assignTime(inputDataTable)
%%
% Function for creating timestamps for each sample of valid RC+S data. Given
% known limitations of all recorded timestamps, need to use multiple variables
% to derive time.
%
% General approach: Remove packets with faulty meta-data.
% Identify gaps in data (by checking deltas in timestamp, systemTick,
% and dataTypeSequence). Consecutive packets of data without gaps
% are referred to as 'chunks'. For each chunk, determine best estimate of
% the first packet time, and then calculate time for each  sample based on
% sampling rate -- assume no missing samples. Best estimate of start time
% for each chunk is determined by taking median (across all packets in that
% chunk) of the offset between delta PacketGenTime and expected time to
% have elapsed (as a function of sampling rate and number of samples
% per packet).
%
% Input: Data table output from createTimeDomainTable or createAccelTable
% (data originating from RawDataTD.json or RawDataAccel.json)
%
% Output: Same as input table, with additional column of 'DerivedTimes' for
% each sample
