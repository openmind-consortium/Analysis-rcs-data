# Compiling

The c code currently uses arrays of pointers to labels. Out of the common compilers, I think GCC is the only one that supports this code. Thus GCC needs to be installed.

I wrote mex_maker to make compiling these types of files a bit easier. The provided code requires the mex_maker repo.
